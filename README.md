# Capstone_Project-II-A_Simple_Game

This program is a simple game programmed in python. The goal of the program was to familiarise myself with pygame. The program takes input from the user in the form of direction buttons pushed. This allows a user controlled character to move in the desired direction of the user's choice.

The goal of the game is to reach a prize, in this case the picture of the beer, before the enemy units do so.

There are three enemy units and they all spawn on random position on the map on either the x or y axis. Everytime the enemy unit hits the side of the screen, they respawn on their specific axis. When they bump into each other, they also respawn.

If an enemey unit collides with the prize, the prize respawns and if the user's character collides with an enemy, the game is over.

## What I learned
1. The use of pygame.
2. How user input is manipualted to trigger a specific occurance on the screen.
3. Movement of objects inside pygame.
4. How to import image files to acts as characters on the screen.
5. Hitboxes around specific images.
6. The movement of images on screen.
